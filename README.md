Currently 👨‍💻 at [XMB](http://github.com/xmb-technology/) building [RTOPilot - Student Management System](https://rtopilot.com.au) to rethink the workflows of Australian education and training.

I spend most of my time working on that, alongside contributing to open-source when I can, reading, activism, running, travelling, and studying ⚛️ physics and computer science at the 🏫 University of New South Wales, Sydney. 19.
